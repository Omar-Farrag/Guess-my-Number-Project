# GUESS MY NUMBER PROJECT

## Description

A simple, interactive, and fun game where a secret number between 1 and 20
is generated and the player has to guess the number.

-    Initially, the secret number is generated and remains hidden from player
-    Player's initial score is 20
-    With each wrong guess, the player's score decrements
-    After each guess, the game will display a message stating whether the guess is high/low
-    If the player's score reaches 0 before correctly guessing the number, the player loses the game
-    Otherwise, the player wins and the highscore is updated

## Credits

This project was completed as part of an Online Course on Udemy titled
**_The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!_** The game's
user interface and rules were both designed by the course instructor, **Jonas Shmedtman**, and
students had to implement the game's logic using Javascript. Still, Jonas guided students all the
way through the implementation by providing walkthrough videos. Therefore, I would like to thank
Jonas for his tremendous commitment to his students and for giving us this great project.
